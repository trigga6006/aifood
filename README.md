# aifood

Omni Impact plans to offer standard AI, as well as agentic solutions to small businesses. 

Our debut service, aifood(placeholder) aims to streamline the process of researching and inquiring food service organizations.
The way aifood will work is by integrating onto the website of a food service providor, and allowing potential customers to inquiry the restruant/chain store through a chatbot.
